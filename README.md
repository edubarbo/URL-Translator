# URL Translator App


The URL Translator app is responsible for automatically listening to the broadcaster events and creating the translated URL in the rewriter app in VTEX. 

## In order to use this app, you have to change some files first. You have to:

1) Update vendor in manifest.json

2) Update vendor in events > update > sender > in service.json

3) Update vendor in parseAndValidate> events.sendEvent in parse.ts

## After linking the app 
Go to your dev workspace admin, in the following path `/admin/apps/{{vendor}}.url-translater-auto@0.0.0/setup/`, in which you have to include the bindingId in which you want to store the translated URLs and the locale of the translations.

FYI: If youâ€™re using a workspace dev to test the translations first, you have to configure the broadcaster to send the events to this specific development workspace with the Notify Target Workspace setting.
